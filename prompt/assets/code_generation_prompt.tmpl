Dataframe Information: 
{dataframe_info_list}
Generate me a executable python code for pandas using the above dataframe description and user question
The code should generate a result to satisfy the user question.

NOTE: the input to the code is a  `List(pd.DataFrame)` object named `dfs` which is already supplied to the code

Q: {query}

if the user asks for any type of plot then only generate the dataframe required for the plot and not the plot itself

generate the result as a dictionary containing two variables type and table 
the type specifies the type of plot eg: line, scatter, bar, pie, area, table etc. 
if any type not found use Default type as 'table'
the table contains the dataframe required for the plot

save the result in a variable named `result`
""" + """
example: ```result = {"type": "table", "table": dataframe}``` or ```result = {"type": "line", "table": dataframe}``` or ```result = {"type": "scatter", "table": dataframe}```

Write code without any ``` formatting
