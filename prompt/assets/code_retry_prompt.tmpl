Dataframe Information: 
{dataframe_info_list}

The user asked the following question:
Q: {query}

You generated this python code:
Code: {code}


Fix the python code above and return the new python code

NOTE: the input to the code is a  `List(pd.DataFrame)` object named `dfs` which is already supplied to the code

if the user asks for any type of plot then only generate the dataframe required for the plot and not the plot itself

generate the result as a dictionary containing two variables type and table 
the type specifies the type of plot eg: line, scatter, bar, pie, table etc.
the table contains the dataframe required for the plot

save the result in a variable named `result`
""" + """
example: ```result = {"type": "table", "table": dataframe}``` or ```result = {"type": "line", "table": dataframe}``` or ```result = {"type": "scatter", "table": dataframe}```

Write code without any ``` formatting
